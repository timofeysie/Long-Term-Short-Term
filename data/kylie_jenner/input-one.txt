The publication also accused her of fabricating revenue figures for Kylie Cosmetics.

It was reported that Global Brands Group (GBG) previously listed the Kendall + Kylie brand on its website. As a result, the Jenners stated that their company is owned by a separate entity known as 3072541 Canada Inc. even though they say that their brand "has worked with CAA-GBG in the past, in a sales and business development capacity only" and that they "do not currently have any relationship at all with GBG".[84] In August 2020, Kylie Cosmetics launched Summer Sailor collection which marked the launch of Jenner's first ever false lashes.[85] In the same month, she made a cameo in Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's "WAP" music video, alongside singers Normani and Rosalía; a petition asking that Jenner's cameo be edited out of the video reached over 65,000 signatures.[86]

Jenner's attorney also demanded that Forbes retract the statements, calling the magazine's accusations "unequivocally false". Forbes reacted, stating that they spent months uncovering the facts and concluded that their "extensively-reported investigation was triggered by newly-filed documents that revealed glaring discrepancies between information privately supplied to journalists and information publicly supplied to shareholders".[125] However, Jenner became the youngest person on Forbes's list of 100 Richest Self-Made Women in October 2020. She is the only person on the list in her 20s, and is worth $700 million.[126]
