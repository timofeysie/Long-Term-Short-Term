Space debris (also known as space junk, space pollution,[1] space waste, space trash, or space garbage) is defunct artificial objects in space—principally in Earth orbit—which no longer serve a useful function. These include derelict spacecraft—nonfunctional spacecraft and abandoned launch vehicle stages—mission-related debris, and particularly numerous in Earth orbit, fragmentation debris from the breakup of derelict rocket bodies and spacecraft. In addition to derelict man-made objects left in orbit, other examples of space debris include fragments from their disintegration, erosion and collisions or even paint flecks, solidified liquids expelled from spacecraft, and unburned particles from solid rocket motors. Space debris represents a risk to spacecraft.[2]

Space debris is typically a negative externality—it creates an external cost on others from the initial action to launch or use a spacecraft in near-Earth orbit—a cost that is typically not taken into account nor fully accounted for in the cost[3][4] by the launcher or payload owner.[5][1][6] The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the space industry.[7]

As of October 2019, the US Space Surveillance Network reported nearly 20,000 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth,[8] including 2,218 operational satellites.[9] However, these are just the objects large enough to be tracked. As of January 2019, more than 128 million pieces of debris smaller than 1 cm (0.4 in), about 900,000 pieces of debris 1–10 cm, and around 34,000 of pieces larger than 10 cm (3.9 in) were estimated to be in orbit around the Earth.[7] When the smallest objects of artificial space debris (paint flecks, solid rocket exhaust particles, etc.) are grouped with micrometeoroids, they are together sometimes referred to by space agencies as MMOD (Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris). Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft; the smallest objects cause damage akin to sandblasting, especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or star trackers that cannot easily be protected by a ballistic shield.[10]

Below 2,000 km (1,200 mi) Earth-altitude, pieces of debris are denser than meteoroids; most are dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from RORSAT (nuclear-powered satellites).[citation needed] For comparison, the International Space Station orbits in the 300–400 kilometres (190–250 mi) range, while the two most recent large debris events—the 2007 Chinese antisat weapon test and the 2009 satellite collision—occurred at 800 to 900 kilometres (500 to 560 mi) altitude.[11] The ISS has Whipple shielding to resist damage from small MMOD; however, known debris with a collision chance over 1/10,000 are avoided by maneuvering the station.

History
Space debris began to accumulate in Earth orbit immediately with the first launch of an artificial satellite Sputnik 1 into orbit in October 1957. But even before that, beside natural ejecta from Earth, humans might have produced ejecta that became space debris, as in the August 1957 Pascal B test.[12][13] After the launch of Sputnik, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) began compiling a database (the Space Object Catalog) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper-stages of launch vehicles. NASA later published[when?] modified versions of the database in two-line element set,[14] and beginning in the early 1980s the CelesTrak bulletin board system re-published them.[15]

The trackers[clarification needed] who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.[16] Some were deliberately caused during the 1960s anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard[clarification needed] kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed[when?] a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modeling of orbital evolution and decay.[17]

When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s,[clarification needed] techniques developed for the asteroid-belt were applied to the study[by whom?] to the database of known artificial satellite Earth objects.[citation needed]

In addition to approaches to debris reduction where time and natural gravitational/atmospheric effects help to clear space debris, or a variety of technological approaches that have been proposed (with most not implemented) to reduce space debris, a number of scholars have observed that institutional factors—political, legal, economic and cultural "rules of the game"—are the greatest impediment to the cleanup of near-Earth space. By 2014, there was little commercial incentive to reduce space debris, since the cost of dealing with it is not assigned to the entity producing it, but rather falls on all users of the space environment, and rely on human society as a whole that benefits from space technologies and knowledge. A number of suggestions for improving institutions so as to increase the incentives to reduce space debris have been made. These include government mandates to create incentives, as well as companies coming to see economic benefit to reducing debris more aggressively than existing government standard practices.[18] In 1979 NASA founded the Orbital Debris Program to research mitigation measures for space debris in Earth orbit.[19][failed verification]

Debris growth
During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One trial solution was implemented by McDonnell Douglas for the Delta launch vehicle,[when?] by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated one source for pressure buildup in the tanks which had previously caused them to explode and create additional orbital debris.[20] Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the Soviet Union, the problem grew throughout the decade.[21]

A new battery of studies followed[when?] as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000,[16] new detectors in the Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.[22] By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,[23] and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an ASAT test and a satellite collision.[24] In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.[25]

A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.[26][27] Richard Crowther of Britain's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015.[28] The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space—900 to 1,000 km (620 mi) and 1,500 km (930 mi)—were already past critical density.[29]

In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, University of Southampton researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. As of 2009, more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.[30]

A 2011 report by the U.S. National Research Council warned NASA that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris "has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures". The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.[31]

Debris history in particular years
As of 2009, 19,000 debris over 5 cm (2 in) were tracked by United States Space Surveillance Network.[11]
As of July 2013, estimates of more than 170 million debris smaller than 1 cm (0.4 in), about 670,000 debris 1–10 cm, and approximately 29,000 larger pieces of debris are in orbit.[32]
As of July 2016, nearly 18,000 artificial objects are orbiting above Earth,[33] including 1,419 operational satellites.[34]
As of October 2019, nearly 20,000 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth,[8] including 2,218 operational satellites.[9]
Characterization
Size
There are estimated to be over 128 million pieces of debris smaller than 1 cm (0.39 in) as of January 2019. There are approximately 900,000 pieces from 1 to 10 cm. The current count of large debris (defined as 10 cm across or larger[35]) is 34,000.[7] The technical measurement cutoff[clarification needed] is c. 3 mm (0.12 in).[36] Over 98 percent of the 1,900 tons of debris in low Earth orbit as of 2002 was accounted for by about 1,500 objects, each over 100 kg (220 lb).[37] Total mass is mostly constant[citation needed] despite addition of many smaller objects, since they reenter the atmosphere sooner. There were "9,000 pieces of orbiting junk" identified in 2008, with an estimated mass of 5,500 t (12,100,000 lb).[38]

Low Earth orbit
In the orbits nearest to Earth—less than 2,000 km (1,200 mi) orbital altitude, referred to as low-Earth orbit (LEO)— there have traditionally been few "universal orbits" that keep a number of spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single orbit that is widely used by over 500 satellites). This is beginning to change in 2019, and several companies have begun to deploy the early phases of satellite internet constellations, which will have many universal orbits in LEO with 30 to 50 satellites per orbital plane and altitude. Traditionally, the most populated LEO orbits have been a number of sun-synchronous satellites that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the orbital plane, making Earth observation easier with consistent sun angle and lighting. Sun-synchronous orbits are polar, meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, typically up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects. The density of satellites—both active and derelict—is much higher in LEO.[39]

Orbits are affected by gravitational perturbations (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field due to variations in the density of the planet), and collisions can occur from any direction. Impacts between orbiting satellites can occur at up to 16 km/s for a theoretical head-on impact; the closing speed could be twice the orbital speed. The 2009 satellite collision occurred at a closing speed of 11.7 km/s (26,000 mph),[40] creating over 2000 large debris fragments.[41] These debris cross many other orbits and increase debris collision risk.

It is theorized that a sufficiently large collision of spacecraft could potentially lead to a cascade effect, or even make some particular low Earth orbits effectively unusable for long term use by orbiting satellites, a phenomenon known as the Kessler syndrome.[42] The theoretical effect is projected to be a theoretical runaway chain reaction of collisions that could occur, exponentially increasing the number and density of space debris in low-Earth orbit, and has been hypothesized to ensue beyond some critical density.[43]

Crewed space missions are mostly at 400 km (250 mi) altitude and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. The upper atmosphere is not a fixed density at any particular orbital altitude; it varies as a result of atmospheric tides and expands or contracts over longer time periods as a result of space weather.[44] These longer-term effects can increase drag at lower altitudes; the 1990s expansion was a factor in reduced debris density.[45] Another factor was fewer launches by Russia; the Soviet Union made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.[46]: 7 

Higher altitudes
At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight atmospheric drag, lunar perturbations, Earth's gravity perturbations, solar wind and solar radiation pressure can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.[47] Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.[contradictory][page needed][48]

Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbits (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as Telstar 401) it assumes a geosynchronous orbit; its orbital inclination increases about .8° and its speed increases about 160 km/h (99 mph) per year. Impact velocity peaks at about 1.5 km/s (0.93 mi/s). Orbital perturbations cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and precession of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year.[49] The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as solar-power satellites, are especially vulnerable to collisions.[50]

Although the ITU now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient.[51] Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under 1 m (3 ft 3 in), the nature of the problem is not well known.[52] Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvering and making it easier to predict future motion.[53] Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in geostationary transfer orbit, are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit.[54] On 29 March 2006, the Russian Express-AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;[55] its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.

Vanguard 1 is expected to remain in orbit for 240 years.[56][57]
In 1958, the United States launched Vanguard I into a medium Earth orbit (MEO). As of October 2009, it, and the upper stage of its launch rocket, were the oldest surviving artificial space objects still in orbit.[58][59] In a catalog of known launches until July 2009, the Union of Concerned Scientists listed 902 operational satellites[60] from a known population of 19,000 large objects and about 30,000 objects launched.[citation needed]

An example of additional derelict satellite debris is the remains of the 1970s/80s Soviet RORSAT naval surveillance satellite program. The satellites' BES-5 nuclear reactors were cooled with a coolant loop of sodium-potassium alloy, creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude graveyard orbits, not all were. Even satellites that had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy,[61] forming additional debris.[62]

In February 2015, the USAF Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Flight 13 (DMSP-F13) exploded on orbit, creating at least 149 debris objects, which were expected to remain in orbit for decades.[63]

Orbiting satellites have been deliberately destroyed. United States and USSR/Russia have conducted over 30 and 27 ASAT tests,[clarification needed] respectively, followed by 10 from China and one from India.[citation needed] The most recent ASATs were Chinese interception of FY-1C, trials of Russian PL-19 Nudol, American interception of USA-193 and Indian interception of unstated live satellite.[citation needed]

Lost equipment

Space debris includes a glove lost by astronaut Ed White on the first American space-walk (EVA), a camera lost by Michael Collins near Gemini 10, a thermal blanket lost during STS-88, garbage bags jettisoned by Soviet cosmonauts during Mir's 15-year life,[58] a wrench, and a toothbrush.[64] Sunita Williams of STS-116 lost a camera during an EVA. During an STS-120 EVA to reinforce a torn solar panel, a pair of pliers was lost, and in an STS-126 EVA, Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper lost a briefcase-sized tool bag.[65]

Boosters

In characterizing the problem of space debris, it was learned that much debris was due to rocket upper stages (e.g. the Inertial Upper Stage) which end up in orbit, and break up due to decomposition of unvented unburned fuel.[66] However, a major known impact event involved an (intact) Ariane booster.[46]: 2  Although NASA and the United States Air Force now require upper-stage passivation, other launchers[vague] do not. Lower stages, like the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters or Apollo program's Saturn IB launch vehicles, do not reach orbit.[67]

On 11 March 2000 a Chinese Long March 4 CBERS-1 upper stage exploded in orbit, creating a debris cloud.[68][69] A Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South Australia on 19 February 2007. Launched on 28 February 2006 carrying an Arabsat-4A communications satellite, it malfunctioned before it could use up its propellant. Although the explosion was captured on film by astronomers, due to the orbit path the debris cloud has been difficult to measure with radar. By 21 February 2007, over 1,000 fragments were identified.[70][71] A 14 February 2007 breakup was recorded by Celestrak.[72] Eight breakups occurred in 2006, the most since 1993.[73] Another Briz-M broke up on 16 October 2012 after a failed 6 August Proton-M launch. The amount and size of the debris was unknown.[74] A Long March 7 rocket booster created a fireball visible from portions of Utah, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho and California on the evening of 27 July 2016; its disintegration was widely reported on social media.[75] In 2018–2019, three different Atlas V Centaur second stages have broken up.[76][77][78]

In December 2020, scientists confirmed that a previously detected near-Earth object, 2020 SO, was rocket booster space junk launched in 1966 orbiting Earth and the Sun.[79]

Weapons
Main category: Intentionally destroyed artificial satellites
A past debris source was the testing of anti-satellite weapons (ASATs) by the U.S. and Soviet Union during the 1960s and 1970s. North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) files only contained data for Soviet tests, and debris from U.S. tests were only identified later.[80] By the time the debris problem was understood, widespread ASAT testing had ended; the U.S. Program 437 was shut down in 1975.[81]

The U.S. restarted their ASAT programs in the 1980s with the Vought ASM-135 ASAT. A 1985 test destroyed a 1-tonne (2,200 lb) satellite orbiting at 525 km (326 mi), creating thousands of debris larger than 1 cm (0.39 in). Due to the altitude, atmospheric drag decayed the orbit of most debris within a decade. A de facto moratorium followed the test.[82]

China's government was condemned for the military implications and the amount of debris from the 2007 anti-satellite missile test,[83] the largest single space debris incident in history (creating over 2,300 pieces golf-ball size or larger, over 35,000 1 cm (0.4 in) or larger, and one million pieces 1 mm (0.04 in) or larger). The target satellite orbited between 850 km (530 mi) and 882 km (548 mi), the portion of near-Earth space most densely populated with satellites.[84] Since atmospheric drag is low at that altitude, the debris is slow to return to Earth, and in June 2007 NASA's Terra environmental spacecraft maneuvered to avoid impact from the debris.[85] Dr. Brian Weeden, U.S. Air Force officer and Secure World Foundation staff member, noted that the 2007 Chinese satellite explosion created an orbital debris of more than 3,000 separate objects that then required tracking.[86] On 20 February 2008, the U.S. launched an SM-3 missile from the USS Lake Erie to destroy a defective U.S. spy satellite thought to be carrying 450 kg (1,000 lb) of toxic hydrazine propellant. The event occurred at about 250 km (155 mi), and the resulting debris has a perigee of 250 km (155 mi) or lower.[87] The missile was aimed to minimize the amount of debris, which (according to Pentagon Strategic Command chief Kevin Chilton) had decayed by early 2009.[88]

On 27 March 2019, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India shot down one of its own LEO satellites with a ground-based missile. He stated that the operation, part of Mission Shakti, would defend the country's interests in space. Afterwards, US Air Force Space Command announced they were tracking 270 new pieces of debris but expected the number to grow as data collection continues.[89]

On 15 November 2021 the Russian Defense Ministry shot down a defunct satellite[90] orbiting at around 450 km, creating "more than 1,500 pieces of trackable debris and hundreds of thousands of pieces of un-trackable debris" according to the US State Department.[91]

The vulnerability of satellites to debris and the possibility of attacking LEO satellites to create debris clouds has triggered speculation that it is possible for countries unable to make a precision attack.[clarification needed] An attack on a satellite of 10 t (22,000 lb) or more would heavily damage the LEO environment.[82]

Hazards
Large glass pit (damage)

To spacecraft
Space junk can be a hazard to active satellites and spacecraft. It has been theorized that Earth orbit could even become impassable if the risk of collision grows too high.[92][failed verification]

However, since the risk to spacecraft increases with the time of exposure to high debris densities, it is more accurate to say that LEO would be rendered unusable by orbiting craft. The threat to craft passing through LEO to reach higher orbit would be much lower owing to the very short time span of the crossing.

Uncrewed spacecraft
Although spacecraft are typically protected by Whipple shields, solar panels, which are exposed to the Sun, wear from low-mass impacts. Even small impacts can produce a cloud of plasma which is an electrical risk to the panels.[93]

Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and (small) orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However, the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects.[94]

Many impacts have been confirmed since. For example, on 24 July 1996, the French microsatellite Cerise was hit by fragments of an Ariane-1 H-10 upper-stage booster which exploded in November 1986.[46]: 2  On 29 March 2006, the Russian Ekspress AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable.[55] On 13 October 2009, Terra suffered a single battery cell failure anomaly and a battery heater control anomaly which were subsequently considered likely the result of an MMOD strike.[95] On 12 March 2010, Aura lost power from one-half of one of its 11 solar panels and this was also attributed to an MMOD strike.[96] On 22 May 2013, GOES-13 was hit by an MMOD which caused it to lose track of the stars that it used to maintain an operational attitude. It took nearly a month for the spacecraft to return to operation.[97]

The first major satellite collision occurred on 10 February 2009. The 950 kg (2,090 lb) derelict satellite Kosmos 2251 and the operational 560 kg (1,230 lb) Iridium 33 collided, 500 mi (800 km)[98] over northern Siberia. The relative speed of impact was about 11.7 km/s (7.3 mi/s), or about 42,120 km/h (26,170 mph).[99] Both satellites were destroyed, creating thousands of pieces of new smaller debris, with legal and political liability issues unresolved even years later.[100][101][102] On 22 January 2013, BLITS (a Russian laser-ranging satellite) was struck by debris suspected to be from the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test, changing both its orbit and rotation rate.[103]

Satellites sometimes[clarification needed] perform Collision Avoidance Maneuvers and satellite operators may monitor space debris as part of maneuver planning. For example, in January 2017, the European Space Agency made the decision to alter orbit of one of its three[104] Swarm mission spacecraft, based on data from the US Joint Space Operations Center, to lower the risk of collision from Cosmos-375, a derelict Russian satellite.[105]

Crewed spacecraft
Crewed flights are naturally particularly sensitive to the hazards that could be presented by space debris conjunctions in the orbital path of the spacecraft. Examples of occasional avoidance maneuvers, or longer-term space debris wear, have occurred in Space Shuttle missions, the MIR space station, and the International Space Station.

Space Shuttle missions

From the early Space Shuttle missions, NASA used NORAD space monitoring capabilities to assess the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this used a large proportion of NORAD capacity.[20] The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during STS-48 in September 1991,[106] a seven-second thruster burn to avoid debris from the derelict satellite Kosmos 955.[107] Similar maneuvers were initiated on missions 53, 72 and 82.[106]

One of the earliest events to publicize the debris problem occurred on Space Shuttle Challenger's second flight, STS-7. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over 1 mm (0.04 in) wide. On STS-59 in 1994, Endeavour's front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.[108]

Window chipping and minor damage to thermal protection system tiles (TPS) were already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take a greater proportion of the debris load on the engines and rear cargo bay, which are not used in orbit or during descent, and thus are less critical for post-launch operation. When flying attached to the ISS, the two connected spacecraft were flipped around so the better-armored station shielded the orbiter.[109]

Bullet-like hole in metallic material
Space Shuttle Endeavour had a major impact on its radiator during STS-118. The entry hole is about 5.5 mm (0.22 in), and the exit hole is twice as large.
A NASA 2005 study concluded that debris accounted for approximately half of the overall risk to the Shuttle.[109][110] Executive-level decision to proceed was required if catastrophic impact was likelier than 1 in 200. On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk was approximately 1 in 300, but the Hubble telescope repair mission was flown at the higher orbital altitude of 560 km (350 mi) where the risk was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 (due in part to the 2009 satellite collision). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.[111]

Debris incidents continued on later Shuttle missions. During STS-115 in 2006 a fragment of circuit board bored a small hole through the radiator panels in Atlantis's cargo bay.[112] On STS-118 in 2007 debris blew a bullet-like hole through Endeavour's radiator panel.[113]

Mir
Impact wear was notable on Mir, the Soviet space station, since it remained in space for long periods with its original solar module panels.[114][115]

Space station with Earth as the background
Debris impacts on Mir's solar panels degraded their performance. The damage is most noticeable on the panel on the right, which is facing the camera with a high degree of contrast. Extensive damage to the smaller panel below is due to impact with a Progress spacecraft.
International Space Station
The ISS also uses Whipple shielding to protect its interior from minor debris.[116] However, exterior portions (notably its solar panels) cannot be protected easily. In 1989, the ISS panels were predicted to degrade approximately 0.23% in four years due to the "sandblasting" effect of impacts with small orbital debris.[117] An avoidance maneuver is typically performed for the ISS if "there is a greater than one-in-10,000 chance of a debris strike".[118] As of January 2014, there have been sixteen maneuvers in the fifteen years the ISS had been in orbit.[118] By 2019, over 1,400 meteoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts had been recorded on the ISS.[119]

As another method to reduce the risk to humans on board, ISS operational management asked the crew to shelter in the Soyuz on three occasions due to late debris-proximity warnings. In addition to the sixteen thruster firings and three Soyuz-capsule shelter orders, one attempted maneuver was not completed due to not having the several days' warning necessary to upload the maneuver timeline to the station's computer.[118][120][121] A March 2009 event involved debris believed to be a 10 cm (3.9 in) piece of the Kosmos 1275 satellite.[122] In 2013, the ISS operations management did not make a maneuver to avoid any debris, after making a record four debris maneuvers the previous year.[118]

Kessler syndrome
Main article: Kessler syndrome
The Kessler syndrome,[123][124] proposed by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, is a theoretical scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade effect where each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.[125] He further theorized that one implication if this were to occur is that the distribution of debris in orbit could render space activities and the use of satellites in specific orbital ranges economically impractical for many generations.[125]

The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,[126] the LEO environment in the 1,000 km (620 mi) altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major satellite collision incident has occurred: the 2009 satellite collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.[127][full citation needed] According to Kessler in 2010 however, a cascade may not be obvious until it is well advanced, which might take years.[128]

On Earth

Although most debris burns up in the atmosphere, larger debris objects can reach the ground intact. According to NASA, an average of one cataloged piece of debris has fallen back to Earth each day for the past 50 years. Despite their size, there has been no significant property damage from the debris.[129] Burning up in the atmosphere may also contribute to atmospheric pollution.[130]

Notable examples of space junk falling to Earth and impacting human life include:

1969: five sailors on a Japanese ship were injured when space debris from what was believed to be a Soviet spacecraft struck the deck of their boat.[131]
1978 The Soviet reconnaissance satellite Kosmos 954 reentered the atmosphere over northwest Canada and scattered radioactive debris over northern Canada, some of the debris landing in the Great Slave Lake.[131]
1979 portions of Skylab came down over Australia, and several pieces landed in the area around the Shire of Esperance, which fined NASA $400 for littering.[131]
1987 a 7-foot strip of metal from the Soviet Kosmos 1890 rocket landed between two homes in Lakeport, California, causing no damage;
1997: an Oklahoma woman, Lottie Williams, was hit, without injury in the shoulder by a 10 cm × 13 cm (3.9 in × 5.1 in) piece of blackened, woven metallic material confirmed as part of the propellant tank of a Delta II rocket which launched a U.S. Air Force satellite the year before.[132][133]
2001: a Star 48 Payload Assist Module (PAM-D) rocket upper stage re-entered the atmosphere after a "catastrophic orbital decay",[134] crashing in the Saudi Arabian desert. It was identified as the upper-stage rocket for NAVSTAR 32, a GPS satellite launched in 1993.[citation needed]
2002: 6 year old boy Wu Jie became the first person to be injured by direct impact from space debris. He suffered a fractured toe and a swelling on his forehead after a block of aluminum, 80 centimeters by 50 centimeters and weighing 10 kilograms from the outermost shell of the Resource Second Satellite struck him as he sat beneath a persimmon tree in the Shaanxi Province of China.[135]
2003: Columbia disaster, large parts of the spacecraft reached the ground and entire equipment systems remained intact.[136] More than 83,000 pieces, along with the remains of the six astronauts, were recovered in an area from three to 10 miles around Hemphill in Sabine County, Texas.[137] More pieces were found in a line from west Texas to east Louisiana, with the westernmost piece found in Littlefield, TX and the easternmost found southwest of Mora, Louisiana.[138] Debris was found in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. In a rare case of property damage, a foot-long metal bracket smashed through the roof of a dentist office.[139] NASA warned the public to avoid contact with the debris because of the possible presence of hazardous chemicals.[140] 15 years after the failure, people were still sending in pieces with the most recent, as of February 2018, found in the spring of 2017.[141]
2007: airborne debris from a Russian spy satellite was seen by the pilot of a LAN Airlines Airbus A340 carrying 270 passengers whilst flying over the Pacific Ocean between Santiago and Auckland. The debris was reported within 9.3 kilometres (5 nmi) of the aircraft.[142]
2020: The empty core stage of a Long March-5B rocket made an uncontrolled re-entry - the largest object to do so since the Soviet Union’s 39 ton Salyut-7 space station in 1991 - over Africa and the Atlantic ocean and a 12-meter-long pipe originating from the rocket crashed into the village of Mahounou in Cote d'Ivoire.[143]
2021: a Falcon 9 second stage made an uncontrolled re-entry over Washington state on March 25, producing a widely seen "light show".[144] A composite-overwrapped pressure vessel survived the re-entry and landed on a farm field.[145]
Tracking and measurement
See also: Satellite tracking
Tracking from the ground
Radar and optical detectors such as lidar are the main tools for tracking space debris. Although objects under 10 cm (4 in) have reduced orbital stability, debris as small as 1 cm can be tracked,[146][147] however determining orbits to allow re-acquisition is difficult. Most debris remain unobserved. The NASA Orbital Debris Observatory tracked space debris with a 3 m (10 ft) liquid mirror transit telescope.[148] FM Radio waves can detect debris, after reflecting off them onto a receiver.[149] Optical tracking may be a useful early-warning system on spacecraft.[150]

The U.S. Strategic Command keeps a catalog of known orbital objects, using ground-based radar and telescopes, and a space-based telescope (originally to distinguish from hostile missiles). The 2009 edition listed about 19,000 objects.[151] Other data come from the ESA Space Debris Telescope, TIRA,[152] the Goldstone, Haystack,[153] and EISCAT radars and the Cobra Dane phased array radar,[154] to be used in debris-environment models like the ESA Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference (MASTER).

Measurement in space

The Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) is an important source of information on small-particle space debris.
Returned space hardware is a valuable source of information on the directional distribution and composition of the (sub-millimetre) debris flux. The LDEF satellite deployed by mission STS-41-C Challenger and retrieved by STS-32 Columbia spent 68 months in orbit to gather debris data. The EURECA satellite, deployed by STS-46 Atlantis in 1992 and retrieved by STS-57 Endeavour in 1993, was also used for debris study.[155]

The solar arrays of Hubble were returned by missions STS-61 Endeavour and STS-109 Columbia, and the impact craters studied by the ESA to validate its models. Materials returned from Mir were also studied, notably the Mir Environmental Effects Payload (which also tested materials intended for the ISS[156]).[157][158]

Gabbard diagrams
A debris cloud resulting from a single event is studied with scatter plots known as Gabbard diagrams, where the perigee and apogee of fragments are plotted with respect to their orbital period. Gabbard diagrams of the early debris cloud prior to the effects of perturbations, if the data were available, are reconstructed. They often include data on newly observed, as yet uncatalogued fragments. Gabbard diagrams can provide important insights into the features of the fragmentation, the direction and point of impact.[17][159]

Dealing with debris
An average of about one tracked object per day has been dropping out of orbit for the past 50 years,[160] averaging almost three objects per day at solar maximum (due to the heating and expansion of the Earth's atmosphere), but one about every three days at solar minimum, usually five and a half years later.[160] In addition to natural atmospheric effects, corporations, academics and government agencies have proposed plans and technology to deal with space debris, but as of November 2014, most of these are theoretical, and there is no extant business plan for debris reduction.[18]

A number of scholars have also observed that institutional factors—political, legal, economic, and cultural "rules of the game"—are the greatest impediment to the cleanup of near-Earth space. There is no commercial incentive, since costs aren't assigned to polluters, but a number of suggestions have been made.[18] However, effects to date are limited. In the US, governmental bodies have been accused of backsliding on previous commitments to limit debris growth, "let alone tackling the more complex issues of removing orbital debris."[161] The different methods for removal of space debris has been evaluated by the Space Generation Advisory Council, including French astrophysicist Fatoumata Kébé.[162]

As of the 2010s, several technical approaches to the mitigation of the growth of space debris are typically undertaken, yet no comprehensive legal regime or cost assignment structure is in place to reduce space debris in the way that terrestrial pollution has reduced since the mid-20th century.

To avoid excessive creation of artificial space debris, many—but not all—satellites launched to above-low-Earth-orbit are launched initially into elliptical orbits with perigees inside Earth's atmosphere so the orbit will quickly decay and the satellites then will destroy themselves upon reentry into the atmosphere. Other methods are used for spacecraft in higher orbits. These include passivation of the spacecraft at the end of its useful life; as well as the use of upper stages that can reignite to decelerate the stage to intentionally deorbit it, often on the first or second orbit following payload release; satellites that can, if they remain healthy for years, deorbit themselves from the lower orbits around Earth. Other satellites (such as many CubeSats) in low orbits below approximately 400 km (250 mi) orbital altitude depend on the energy-absorbing effects of the upper atmosphere to reliably deorbit a spacecraft within weeks or months.

Increasingly, spent upper stages in higher orbits—orbits for which low-delta-v deorbit is not possible, or not planned for—and architectures that support satellite passivation, at end of life are passivated at end of life. This removes any internal energy contained in the vehicle at the end of its mission or useful life. While this does not remove the debris of the now derelict rocket stage or satellite itself, it does substantially reduce the likelihood of the spacecraft destructing and creating many smaller pieces of space debris, a phenomenon that was common in many of the early generations of US and Soviet[62] spacecraft.

Upper stage passivation (e.g. of Delta boosters[20]) by releasing residual propellants reduces debris from orbital explosions; however even as late as 2011, not all upper stages implement this practice.[164] SpaceX used the term "propulsive passivation" for the final maneuver of their six-hour demonstration mission (STP-2) of the Falcon 9 second stage for the US Air Force in 2019, but did not define what all that term encompassed.[165]

With a "one-up, one-down" launch-license policy for Earth orbits, launchers would rendezvous with, capture and de-orbit a derelict satellite from approximately the same orbital plane.[166] Another possibility is the robotic refueling of satellites. Experiments have been flown by NASA,[167] and SpaceX is developing large-scale on-orbit propellant transfer technology.[168]

Another approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to always leave the rocket second-stage in an elliptical geocentric orbit with a low-perigee, thus ensuring rapid orbital decay and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies. Such missions will often complete the payload placement in a final orbit by the use of low-thrust electric propulsion or with the use of a small kick stage to circularize the orbit. The kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit.[169]

Self-removal
Although the ITU requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives, the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect GEO lanes from debris.[51] Rocket stages (or satellites) with enough propellant may make a direct, controlled de-orbit, or if this would require too much propellant, a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit. This was done with the French Spot-1 satellite, reducing its atmospheric re-entry time from a projected 200 years to about 15 by lowering its altitude from 830 km (516 mi) to about 550 km (342 mi).[170][171]

The Iridium constellation—95 communication satellites launched during the five-year period between 1997 and 2002—provides a set of data points on the limits of self-removal. The satellite operator—Iridium Communications—remained operational (albeit with a company name change through a corporate bankruptcy during the period) over the two-decade life of the satellites, and by December 2019, had "completed disposal of the last of its 65 working legacy satellites."[172] However, this process left nearly one-third of the mass of this constellation (30 satellites, 20,400 kg (45,000 lb) of materiel) in LEO orbits at approximately 700 km (430 mi) altitude, where self-decay is quite slow. 29 of these satellites simply failed during their time in orbit and were thus unable to self-deorbit, while one—Iridium 33—was involved in the 2009 satellite collision with the derelict Russian military Kosmos-2251 satellite.[172] No "Plan B" provision was designed in for removal of the satellites that were unable to remove themselves. However, in 2019, Iridium CEO Matt Desch said that Iridium would be willing to pay an active-debris-removal company to deorbit its remaining first-generation satellites if it were possible for a sufficiently low cost, say "US$10,000 per deorbit, but [he] acknowledged that price would likely be far below what a debris-removal company could realistically offer. 'You know at what point [it’s] a no-brainer, but [I] expect the cost is really in the millions or tens of millions, at which price I know it doesn’t make sense.'"[172]

Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed. Instead of rockets, an electrodynamic tether could be attached to a spacecraft at launch; at the end of its lifetime, the tether would be rolled out to slow the spacecraft.[173] Other proposals include a booster stage with a sail-like attachment[174] and a large, thin, inflatable balloon envelope.[175]

External removal
A variety of approaches have been proposed, studied, or had ground subsystems built to use other spacecraft to remove existing space debris. A consensus of speakers at a meeting in Brussels in October 2012, organized by the Secure World Foundation (a U.S. think tank) and the French International Relations Institute,[176] reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future (without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in LEO). To date in 2019, removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action. Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions.

Some companies made plans in the late 2010s to begin to do external removal on their satellites in mid-LEO orbits. For example, OneWeb planned to utilize onboard self-removal as "plan A" for satellite deorbiting at the end of life, but if a satellite were unable to remove itself within one year of end of life, OneWeb would implement "plan B" and dispatch a reusable (multi-transport mission) space tug to attach to the satellite at an already built-in capture target via a grappling fixture, to be towed to a lower orbit and released for re-entry.[177][178]

Remotely controlled vehicles
A well-studied solution uses a remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with, capture, and return debris to a central station.[179] One such system is Space Infrastructure Servicing, a commercially developed refueling depot and service spacecraft for communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit originally scheduled for a 2015 launch.[180] The SIS would be able to "push dead satellites into graveyard orbits."[181] The Advanced Common Evolved Stage family of upper stages is being designed with a high leftover-propellant margin (for derelict capture and de-orbit) and in-space refueling capability for the high delta-v required to de-orbit heavy objects from geosynchronous orbit.[166] A tug-like satellite to drag debris to a safe altitude for it to burn up in the atmosphere has been researched.[182] When debris is identified the satellite creates a difference in potential between the debris and itself, then using its thrusters to move itself and the debris to a safer orbit.

A variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris, capture it temporarily to attach a smaller de-orbit satellite and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location. The "mothership" would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for atmospheric entry or move it to a graveyard orbit. One such system is the proposed Busek ORbital DEbris Remover (ORDER), which would carry over 40 SUL (satellite on umbilical line) de-orbit satellites and propellant sufficient for their removal.[18]

cleanspace one
Cleanspace One
On 7 January 2010 Star, Inc. reported that it received a contract from the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command for a feasibility study of the ElectroDynamic Debris Eliminator (EDDE) propellantless spacecraft for space-debris removal.[183] In February 2012 the Swiss Space Center at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne announced the Clean Space One project, a nanosatellite demonstration project for matching orbit with a defunct Swiss nanosatellite, capturing it and de-orbiting together.[184] The mission has seen several evolutions to reach a pac-man inspired capture model.[185] In 2013, Space Sweeper with Sling-Sat (4S), a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris was studied.[186][needs update]

In December 2019, the European Space Agency awarded the first contract to clean up space debris. The €120 million mission dubbed ClearSpace-1 (a spinoff from the EPFL project) is slated to launch in 2025. It aims to remove a 100 kg VEga Secondary Payload Adapter (Vespa)[187] left by Vega flight VV02 in an 800 km (500 mi) orbit in 2013. A "chaser" will grab the junk with four robotic arms and drag it down to Earth's atmosphere where both will burn up.[188]

Laser methods
The laser broom uses a ground-based laser to ablate the front of the debris, producing a rocket-like thrust that slows the object. With continued application, the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag.[189][190] During the late 1990s, the U.S. Air Force's Project Orion was a laser-broom design.[191] Although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a Space Shuttle in 2003, international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements.[192] The 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster postponed the project and according to Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program manager for NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, "There are lots of little gotchas in the Orion final report. There's a reason why it's been sitting on the shelf for more than a decade."[193]

The momentum of the laser-beam photons could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of 1 mm (0.039 in) per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by 200 m (660 ft) per day.[194] One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem.[citation needed] A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit, using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry.[18] A proposal to replace the laser with an Ion Beam Shepherd has been made,[195] and other proposals use a foamy ball of aerogel or a spray of water,[196] inflatable balloons,[197] electrodynamic tethers,[198] electroadhesion,[199] and dedicated anti-satellite weapons.[200]

Nets
On 28 February 2014, Japan's Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched a test "space net" satellite. The launch was an operational test only.[201] In December 2016 the country sent a space junk collector via Kounotori 6 to the ISS by which JAXA scientists experiment to pull junk out of orbit using a tether.[202][203] The system failed to extend a 700-meter tether from a space station resupply vehicle that was returning to Earth.[204][205] On 6 February the mission was declared a failure and leading researcher Koichi Inoue told reporters that they "believe the tether did not get released".[206]

Since 2012, the European Space Agency has been working on the design of a mission to remove large space debris from orbit. The mission, e.Deorbit, is scheduled for launch during 2023 with an objective to remove debris heavier than 4,000 kilograms (8,800 lb) from LEO.[207] Several capture techniques are being studied, including a net, a harpoon and a combination robot arm and clamping mechanism.[208]

Harpoon
The RemoveDEBRIS mission plan is to test the efficacy of several ADR technologies on mock targets in low Earth orbit. In order to complete its planned experiments the platform is equipped with a net, a harpoon, a laser ranging instrument, a dragsail, and two CubeSats (miniature research satellites).[209] The mission was launched on 2 April 2018.

National and international regulation
There is no international treaty minimizing space debris. However, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) published voluntary guidelines in 2007,[210] using a variety of earlier national regulatory attempts at developing standards for debris mitigation. As of 2008, the committee was discussing international "rules of the road" to prevent collisions between satellites.[211] By 2013, a number of national legal regimes existed,[212][213][214] typically instantiated in the launch licenses that are required for a launch in all spacefaring nations.[215]

The U.S. issued a set of standard practices for civilian (NASA) and military (DoD and USAF) orbital-debris mitigation in 2001.[216][217][213] The standard envisioned disposal for final mission orbits in one of three ways: 1) atmospheric reentry where even with "conservative projections for solar activity, atmospheric drag will limit the lifetime to no longer than 25 years after completion of mission;" 2) maneuver to a "storage orbit:" move the spacecraft to one of four very broad parking orbit ranges (2,000–19,700 km (1,200–12,200 mi), 20,700–35,300 km (12,900–21,900 mi), above 36,100 km (22,400 mi), or out of Earth orbit completely and into any heliocentric orbit; 3) "Direct retrieval: Retrieve the structure and remove it from orbit as soon as practicable after completion of mission."[212] The standard articulated in option 1, which is the standard applicable to most satellites and derelict upper stages launched, has come to be known as the "25-year rule."[218] The US updated the ODMSP in December 2019, but made no change to the 25-year rule even though "[m]any in the space community believe that the timeframe should be less than 25 years."[216] There is no consensus however on what any new timeframe might be.[216]

In 2002, the European Space Agency (ESA) worked with an international group to promulgate a similar set of standards, also with a "25-year rule" applying to most Earth-orbit satellites and upper stages. Space agencies in Europe began to develop technical guidelines in the mid-1990s, and ASI, UKSA, CNES, DLR and ESA signed a "European Code of Conduct" in 2006,[214] which was a predecessor standard to the ISO international standard work that would begin the following year. In 2008, ESA further developed "its own "Requirements on Space Debris Mitigation for Agency Projects" which "came into force on 1 April 2008."[214]

Germany and France have posted bonds to safeguard the property from debris damage.[clarification needed][219] The "direct retrieval" option (option no. 3 in the US "standard practices" above) has rarely been done by any spacefaring nation (exception, USAF X-37) or commercial actor since the earliest days of spaceflight due to the cost and complexity of achieving direct retrieval, but the ESA has scheduled a 2025 demonstration mission (Clearspace-1) to do this with a single small 100 kg (220 lb) derelict upper stage at a projected cost of €120 million not including the launch costs.[188]

By 2006, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) had developed a number of technical means of debris mitigation (upper stage passivation, propellant reserves for movement to graveyard orbits, etc.) for ISRO launch vehicles and satellites, and was actively contributing to inter-agency debris coordination and the efforts of the UN COPUOS committee.[220]

In 2007, the ISO began preparing an international standard for space-debris mitigation.[221] By 2010, ISO had published "a comprehensive set of space system engineering standards aimed at mitigating space debris. [with primary requirements] defined in the top-level standard, ISO 24113." By 2017, the standards were nearly complete. However, these standards are not binding on any party by ISO or any international jurisdiction. They are simply available for use in any of a variety of voluntary ways. They "can be adopted voluntarily by a spacecraft manufacturer or operator, or brought into effect through a commercial contract between a customer and supplier, or used as the basis for establishing a set of national regulations on space debris mitigation."[218]

The voluntary ISO standard also adopted the "25-year rule" for the "LEO protected region" below 2,000 km (1,200 mi) altitude that has been previously (and still is, as of 2019) used by the US, ESA, and UN mitigation standards, and identifies it as "an upper limit for the amount of time that a space system shall remain in orbit after its mission is completed. Ideally, the time to deorbit should be as short as possible (i.e., much shorter than 25 years)".[218]

Holger Krag of the European Space Agency states that as of 2017 there is no binding international regulatory framework with no progress occurring at the respective UN body in Vienna.[92]

In popular culture
Until the End of the World (1991) is a French sci-fi drama set under the backdrop of an out-of-control Indian nuclear satellite, predicted to re-enter the atmosphere, threatening vast populated areas of the Earth.[222]

In the Planetes, a Japanese hard science fiction manga (1999-2004) and anime (2003-2004), the story revolves around the crew of a space debris collection craft in the year 2075.

Gravity, a 2013 survival film directed by Alfonso Cuaron, is about a disaster on a space mission caused by Kessler syndrome.[223]

In season 1 of Love, Death & Robots (2019), episode 11, "Helping Hand", revolves around an astronaut being struck by a screw from space debris which knocks her off a satellite in orbit.[224]

MOSCOW (AP) — Russian officials on Tuesday rejected accusations that they endangered astronauts aboard the International Space Station by conducting a weapons test that created more than 1,500 pieces of space junk but a White House official said the move by Russia would threaten activities in space “for years to come.”

U.S. officials on Monday accused Russia of destroying an old satellite with a missile in what they called a reckless and irresponsible strike. They said the debris could damage the space station, an assessment backed by NATO’s chief.

Astronauts now face four times greater risk than normal from space junk, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told The Associated Press. The defunct Russian satellite Cosmos 1408 was orbiting about 40 miles (65 kilometers) higher than the space station.

The test clearly demonstrates that Russia, “despite its claims of opposing the weaponization of outer space, is willing to ... imperil the exploration and use of outer space by all nations through its reckless and irresponsible behavior,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Tuesday that Russia’s action demonstrated its “complete disregard for the security, safety, stability and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations. This debris will continue to pose a direct threat to activities in outer space for years to come and puts at risk satellites all nations rely on for national security, economic prosperity and scientific discovery.” He said the United States would work with its allies “as we seek to respond to this irresponsible act.”

Even a fleck of paint can do major damage when orbiting at 17,500 mph (28,000 kph). Something big, upon impact, could be catastrophic to the space station.

Russia’s Defense Ministry on Tuesday confirmed carrying out a test and destroying a defunct satellite that has been in orbit since 1982, but insisted that “the U.S. knows for certain that the resulting fragments, in terms of test time and orbital parameters, did not and will not pose a threat to orbital stations, spacecraft and space activities.” It called remarks by U.S. officials “hypocritical.”

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the strike was carried out “with surgical precision” and posed no threat to the space station. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also charged that it is “hypocrisy” to say that Russia creates risks for peaceful activities in space.

The Russian space agency Roscosmos wouldn’t confirm or deny that the strike took place, saying only that the “unconditional safety of the crew has been and remains our main priority.”

Once the situation became clear early Monday morning, those on board the International Space Station — four Americans, one German and two Russians — were ordered to immediately seek shelter in their docked capsules. They spent two hours in the two capsules, finally emerging only to have to close and reopen hatches to the station’s individual labs on every orbit, or 1 1/2 hours, as they passed near or through the space debris.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg agreed that Russia’s actions endangered the space station.

“This was a reckless act by Russia to actually shoot down and destroy a satellite as part of a test of an anti-satellite weapons system,” which created a lot of space debris, Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.

He said it was of additional concern “because it demonstrates that Russia is now developing new weapons systems that can shoot down the satellites, can destroy important space capabilities for basic infrastructure on Earth, like communications, like navigation, or like early warning of missile launches.”

The German Foreign Ministry also said it was “very concerned” by the test, which it said resulted in “additional risks” for the astronauts on the ISS.

“This irresponsible behavior carries a high risk of miscalculations and escalation,” the ministry said, adding that the test underlines the urgency of an international agreement on rules for the peaceful use of space.

NASA Mission Control said the heightened threat could continue to interrupt the astronauts’ science research and other work. Four of the seven crew members only arrived at the orbiting outpost on Thursday night.

A similar weapons test by China in 2007 also resulted in countless pieces of debris. One of those threatened to come dangerously close to the space station last week. While later the risk it posed was dismissed, NASA had the space station move anyway.

Anti-satellite missile tests by the U.S. in 2008 and India in 2019 were conducted at much lower altitudes, well below the space station, which orbits about 260 miles (420 kilometers) high.

PORTLAND, Ore. — If only the Trail Blazers could figure out why they're successful at home but struggle on the road.

CJ McCollum had 29 points and  added 24 to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 118-113 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Monday night.

The Blazers, who were playing the second of a back-to-back, improved to 6-1 at home. That's in stark contrast to the road, where Portland is 1-7.

“When we play at home, it's a different team than when we play on the road. That's just the truth. And I'm not sure what it is,” Lillard said. “I think when you're at home there's just a level of comfort and support that you feel from the fans. But at the same time, we're NBA players. We play on the road a lot.”

 had 27 points for the Raptors, who have lost five of six.  added 20.

“They made tough shots,” Anunoby said. “We were playing hard. They’re making tough shots, but we were playing hard. That’s how it goes sometimes. They have good players on their team.”

It was a streaky fourth quarter for both teams. Larry Nance Jr.'s alley-oop dunk gave Portland a 99-89 lead before McCollum's 3-pointer pushed it to 105-92.

The Raptors rallied with a 9-0 run, pulling to 105-101 on 's 3-pointer with 5:34 left. Portland didn't let Toronto get any closer, and Lillard's 3 stretched the Blazers' lead to 110-101.

VanVleet made consecutive 3-pointers to narrow it to 112-111 with 1:51 to go. After  made free throws for Portland, McCollum hit a jumper to make it a five-point game. Nance's dunk all but sealed the win with 38.5 seconds left.

Nance finished with 15 points off the bench.

“We've got a rest day tomorrow, so I can sleep all day if I want. So there was no excuse not to use every bit of energy we had,” Nance said. “I thought we did an outstanding job in the fourth quarter of fighting off their runs and making some of our own.”

Lillard was questionable before the game because of an abdominal strain, but he started. Lillard missed the Blazers' loss at Denver on Sunday night with the injury.

Lillard has had a slow start to the season, averaging 20 points a game, well off his average last season.

VanVleet returned to the Raptors after missing a game with groin soreness, but centre Precious Achiuwa missed a second straight game with right shoulder tendinitis.

Toronto led by 14 early and went into the second quarter up 33-24. Anunoby had 14 points, including four 3-pointers in the opening quarter alone.

The Blazers ended the first half on a 9-0 run to take a 61-60 lead at the break.

Portland stretched the lead to eight in the third quarter, but Toronto tied it at 85 going into the final period on Malachi Flynn's driving layup.

Lillard and McCollum hit back-to-back 3-pointers to give the Blazers a 93-85 lead.

“The start of the second and the start of the fourth really let us down,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “It changed the momentum and put us in a hole in the fourth.”

TIP-INS

Raptors: It was the first of a six-game road trip. ... Gary Trent Jr. played his first two-plus seasons in Portland. ... All five of Toronto's starters were in double figures.

“I still feel like we’ve got a lot of room to grow,” Toronto centre  said. “We’ve got a lot of young guys who are still developing. We’ve just got to be patient and it's gonna come soon."

Trail Blazers: Lillard had 10 of his 16 first-half points in the second quarter. ... Portland was coming off a 1-3 road trip. ... Lillard had eight assists. ... McCollum had six 3-pointers.

Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers) with a 3-pointer vs the Toronto Raptors, 11/15/2021

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) Damian Lillard helped Portland surge ahead in the third quarter. CJ McCollum finished the job in the closing minutes.

McCollum scored seven of his 23 points in the final two minutes and the Trail Blazers beat the Toronto Raptors 122-117 on Sunday night.

Lillard had 22 points and 11 assists for the Blazers, who took command of their third straight win - all on the road - by holding Toronto to 10 points in the third quarter.

''I thought we did a good job on their two guys most of the night, but we couldn't get by that dry quarter,'' Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ''The biggest thing was the turnovers. We couldn't quite handle the physicality.''

Pascal Siakam finished with 26 points and eight rebounds, and Fred VanVleet added 20 points and eight assists for Toronto, which lost for the 11th time in 12 games. The Raptors shot 4 for 22 with five turnovers in the third quarter.

The game was played three days after the trade deadline move in which the Raptors sent Norman Powell to the Blazers for Gary Trent Jr. and Rodney Hood.

Lillard, who sat out Friday night's win at Orlando with a left knee contusion, joined Powell in Portland's three-guard starting lineup, which didn't get a long look..

''Norman got two quick fouls and we only played about four minutes in that stretch with that group,'' Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ''But we'll play that lineup. It's just a matter of when and where and what the matchups are.''

Derrick Jones Jr., bumped from the lineup, scored Portland's final seven points of the first half, but Hood's 3-pointer at the buzzer gave Toronto a 74-68 halftime edge.

Jones finished with 16 points and three rebounds in 21 minutes.

''He really had an impact on the game in he second half,'' Stotts said.

The Raptors led 82-75 when Siakam scored on a short jumper with 6:27 left in the third quarter. But Toronto was held scoreless for nearly six minutes.

''We felt like a really good defense in that third quarter. We were out there communicating and working things out. It was good to have (Powell) out there,'' said Lillard. ''Typically, we do well with three-guard lineups, and he's a physical guard.''

A steal and a dunk by Powell put the Blazers ahead 83-82, and Lillard scored seven points in a 16-2 run that closed the third quarter with Portland leading 91-84.

VanVleet led a late rally that got the Raptors within one with 2:28 left, but McCollum answered with a jumper, a runner and a three-point play.

''We've got to win a close game at some point,'' VanVleet said, ''but they've got two guys that can close the game for them.''

TIP-INS

Blazers: Powell scored 13 points in 27 minutes in his second Portland start. ... Robert Covington made the game's first 3-pointer with 6:01 left in the first quarter, and both teams made two 3-pointers in the next 48 seconds. ... F Nassir Little missed the game with an injured thumb.

Raptors: G Kyle Lowry was out with a sore right foot. ... F DeAndre Bembry and G Paul Watson Jr. missed a second game due to the COVID protocol.

[Church] Enes Kanter told CNN in an exclusive interview that despite speaking out on issues such as Blaсk Lives Mattеr, the NBA has stayed silent on Сhina, highlighting its struggle in balancing player activism with the lucrative Chinеse market. “NBA made me do this,” Kanter said.

Boston Celtics star Enes Kanter says he felt encouraged to speak out against Сhina after the NBA supported players in fighting other injustices and human rights issues.

In recent months, Kanter has used social media posts and specially designed clothing during NBA games to bring awareness to China's treatment of the Uyghur community, Tibеt, Taiwan and Hоng Kong. His posts and comments have caused a backlash in China with Celtics games being pulled by Chinese video-streaming site Tencent and the government criticizing the 29-year-old's comments.

Kanter told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview that despite speaking out on issues such as Black Lives Matter, the NBA has stayed silent on China -- highlighting its struggle in balancing player activism with the lucrative Chinese market.

"NBA made me do this," Kanter said. "Because every time when one of the NBA teams or the commissioner comes out to speak, they say we are encouraging players to talk about whatever they want to talk about.

"We are giving freedom to our players to talk about all the injustices happening around the world, all the human rights abuses around the world. So, they gave me this right."

Kanter says he sat down privately with NBA officials and commissioner Adam Silver, who says Silver has backed Kanter's right to freedom of speech.

The Celtics center says he has no intention of breaking NBA rules but is concerned as to why the NBA has yet to release a public statement on the issue. "If they were really supporting me, they would have put something out there. They would have put out some kind of statement," he said.

"People think I do politics, I don't do politics. I do human rights."

CNN has reached out to the NBA for comment but has yet to receive a response.

"There are so many athletes, so many actors, so many singers and so many people who have a platform that are speaking out about many of the issues out there in the world.

"But when it comes to China [...] they are scared because they care too much about money, they care too much about business and they care too much about endorsement deals.

"To me, the human rights, and saving people's lives, comes first

Raptors Offensive Development Paying Off, But Defense Struggles Against Portland
The Toronto Raptors showed the kind of offensive development they've been looking for but the defense wasn't there against the Portland Trail Blazers

Just look at what the Toronto Raptors did this past offseason and it's clear they’re taking a very different approach to roster construction. While most of the league has gone all-in for three-point shooters, the Raptors have zagged, spurning the expensive sharpshooter market, and instead devoted their attention to defensive stoppers and versatility. It’s a strategy that comes from an unwavering belief in their developmental program and the magic touch from Nick Nurse’s shooting school.

Even if it’s not always pretty, Monday night’s 118-113 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers showed why that plan should work in the long run.

Take Norman Powell, for example. When the 28-year-old now-Trail Blazers guard first arrived in Toronto in 2015 there were major questions about his three-point shooting. He averaged 31.4% from behind the arc in college and the scouting report on him raised red flags offensively. But Toronto got to work with the UCLA product, tweaking his stroke a little bit, and the results speak for themselves.

“He’s almost doubled his percentage of what he shot in college,” Nurse said Monday. “I always say this, we can give ‘em suggestions and make tweaks, do things, and then it goes squarely right on their table to go to work on it. And you guys know how hard that guy worked to become an NBA shooter and now an NBA elite shooter.”

Or how about OG Anunoby, who came out against Portland and nailed six three-pointers in the first half alone? He was a bit of an inconsistent shooter in college and was considered more of a defensive prospect than an offensive difference-maker. Now, five years into his NBA career, the progress has been astounding. Anunoby is no longer just a catch-and-shoot 3-and-D specialist, he’s showing far more offensive range, creating for himself occasionally and turning into a true three-point marksman. He led all Raptors with 28 points against the Trail Blazers.

Scottie Barnes Takes Pole Position in Rookie of the Year Odds
The problem for Toronto on Monday, however, wasn’t the offense. Even with so many players still developing on that side of the court, the Raptors’ defense looked lost against the high octane Trail Blazers. Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum repeatedly beat Toronto's defense for blow-by buckets at the rim or deadly three-pointers. Just when Toronto cut Portland's lead down to four thanks to a 7-0 run, McCollum nailed a floater and found Larry Nance Jr. for a transition dunk to close out the night.

Fred VanVleet did go toe to toe with Lillard down the stretch, looking every bit his equal in the fourth quarter. After a slow start, scoring just five points through three quarters, Toronto's lead guard broke out for 11 points in the fourth, nailing a trio of clutch three-pointers to keep the Raptors alive late.

The Trail Blazers certainly deserve credit for the offensive firepower they showed. They had one of their best shooting performance of the season, killing Toronto with a 56% mark from the floor, but the Raptors are supposed to be a team built to prevent nights like that from happening. Unfortunately for Toronto, Nurse's hyper-aggressive defensive scheme has created a few too many open shots for opposing teams to take advantage of.

Barnes T’ed Up For Clapping?
Rookie Scottie Barnes was involved in a very strange moment in the second quarter. He was called for a very ticky-tack foul on Lillard and quickly turned around and started clapping to himself. It was apparently enough to warrant his first career technical.

The Raptors will have a couple of days off before their Thursday night date with the Utah Jazz.

Portland Trail Blazers shake off sluggish start to beat Toronto Raptors 118-113

The Portland Trail Blazers certainly needed some home-court vibes after returning home from a four-game road trip that saw them lose three and play poorly in the lone game that they won over one of the worst teams in the league.

They returned to the Moda Center a night after losing 124-95 at Denver and immediately looked as if they were going to suffer a similar fate by falling behind 13-3 to Toronto.


But the Blazers weren’t going to go out like that on this night. They got their act together, started playing defense, got hot on offense and earned a much-needed 118-113 victory Monday night.

“I thought we competed,” Damian Lillard said

CJ McCollum led Portland with 29 points on 11-of-18 shooting. Lillard finished with 24 points and eight assists.


“I think tonight we started off slow and then we kind of picked it up and do what we need to do to get win the game,” McCollum said.

WHAT IT MEANS

The Blazers (7-8) are clearly a different team at home and it’s becoming sort of surreal. They now sit at 6-1 at the Moda Center and 1-7 on the road.

Portland coach Chauncey Billups said after the game that he was encouraged to see a greater effort from his team on the second night of a back-to-back but must figure out how to play tougher on the road.

“For the most part we’ve kind of figured out how hard we have to play at home,” Billups said. “We’ve done a good job of that. We’ve got to find a way for our game to travel away but they brought the effort tonight. They really did. We knew we were playing against a team that plays extremely, extremely hard. And if we didn’t, we’d get ourselves in trouble. But, I mean, on a back-to-back, long trip home, demoralizing loss yesterday, fifth game in seven days; it’s just a great effort.”


GAME RECAP

The Blazers began this game similarly to how poorly they started at Denver and promptly fell behind 13-3 before three minutes had passed in the quarter. Portland bounced back and finished the quarter down 33-24 after allowing the Raptors to shoot 59.1% from the field and shoot 7 of 13 on mostly wide-open threes. OG Anunoby scored 14 for the Raptors (7-8).

The defense of the Blazers’ second unit played a big part in slowing down the Raptors in the second quarter. Toronto shot just 36.4% for the quarter while finding baskets difficult to come by, especially when Nassir Little, Larry Nance Jr. and Tony Snell were on the floor for Portland. Meanwhile, the Blazers took over as the hot team on offense, shooting 71.4% from the field. Lillard scored 10 points in the quarter, which the Blazers won 37-27 to take a 61-60 lead into halftime. Anunoby scored 23 in the first half. Lillard had 16.


The game stood at 85-85 heading into the fourth quarter, when the Blazers seized and then maintained control thanks in large art to Nance and Little. Both played the entire fourth quarter to help defend against Toronto’s small lineup.

“They gave us so much versatility,” Billups. “I thought they played extremely hard.”

Portland began the fourth with a 20-footer from McCollum, a three from Lillard and then a three from McCollum to lead 93-85. The Raptors trailed 99-92 with 8:07 remaining before the Blazers went on another run. This one began with a Little three and ended with a McCollum three off of a slick pass from Lillard after he drove to the left side of the lane. The basket gave the Blazers a 105-92 lead with 7:20 to go and triggered a Raptors timeout. The subsequent discussion paid off for the Raptors, who answered with a 9-0 run to make the score 105-91 with 5:34 to go.

Portland got to a 112-105 lead, but Fred VanVleet hit two threes to leave the score at 112-111 with 1:51 to go.


But Portland dominated the rest of the way. The key moment came when McCollum sized up Gary Trent Jr. like a shark eyeing familiar prey, pump faked his former teammate into the air and then scored on the leaner to give the Blazers a 116-111 lead with 48.3 seconds left.

Trent scored 18 points with six rebounds after receiving a big ovation while being introduced with the starters.

Raptors: 1 stud and 1 dud from difficult loss to Trail Blazers

COMMENT
OG Anunoby and the Toronto Raptors looked to bounce back after a loss against the lowry Pistons by kicking off their West Coast swing in promising fashion against the Portland Trail Blazers. Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, and old friend Norman Powell could provide a very daunting task for the likes of Pascal Siakam and Khem Birch.

The Raptors had lost three of their last four games following a five-game winning streak, and with many of the Western Conference’s elite on the schedule, Toronto needed a win in the worst way.

That victory didn’t come, as Portland managed to hold on to a 118-113 win despite a furious late charge from Nick Nurse’s team. Scottie Barnes put in a nice night of work tonight, but a couple of ill-timed turnovers in the closing minutes of the game ultimately did them in.

The Toronto Raptors may have lost thanks to some suspect performances from key role players, but some star players on this roster played well.

TRAIL BLAZERS

OG Anunoby was the best player for the Toronto Raptors.
While the Raptors’ defense has completely capitulated over the last few games, the offense has taken some steps in the right direction. Anunoby had one of the best halves of basketball in his career last night, as he helped keep the Raptors alive and withstand some major Portland broadsides.

Anunoby scored 29 points on 9-19 shooting and 6-10 from 3-point range. The only reason the wheels didn’t completely come off in the second quarter was Anunoby’s white-hot shooting. After some iffy shooting nights, No. 3 found his groove.


Anunoby was merely OK on defense tonight, but the Blazers were hitting pretty much everything irrespective of how well Toronto defended. This was Anunoby’s best offensive game since Siakam returned, which is a good sign for this lineup.

Anunoby’s growth as a scorer was obvious when Siakam was on the mend, and it looks like he’s still going to be just as lethal with No. 43 back into the lineup. Toronto didn’t get a win, but this is not on Anunoby’s shoulders.

Khem Birch had a tough game for the Toronto Raptors.
With the already thin frontcourt depleted, Birch needed to play one of his best games of the season to make sure that the Raptors pulled out the victory. Not only did he fail to accomplish that task, but he put together one of the worst showings he’s had since he came to Toronto.

Birch’s six points and four rebounds are right around what his season averages are, but that doesn’t show how he was hunted on both ends by Jusuf Nurkic and Cody Zeller. Nurkic only played 18 minutes, and he still tallied 14 rebounds. Zeller had no issue making a few baskets tonight.


Birch is not a bad player, nor is he at risk of losing minutes, but Nurkic and Zeller both had minimal issues getting rebounds and interior looks against him. Birch has been occupying a more traditional center role for this team, and when he struggles against players like Nurkic, Toronto lacks players with similar skill sets that can slow their opponents down.

The Raptors will take on one of the best centers in the game in Rudy Gobert on this road trip. A matchup against Steven Adams and Jaren Jackson Jr. in Memphis just days after is also concerning. Birch will have better days, but Portland made it a point to focus on him on Monday night.

Too many turnovers and sloppy play.   The rookies, are not supposed to be carrying the load.

Birch and Achiuwa are not the long term answer at centre.  Nurkic and Zeller proved that last night. We all saw this before.  This Raptor team is built to fail at centre.

A poor showing vs a beatable team to start the road trip. That's generally not a great sign.
The minimal attention the C position got from management by signing Birch is hurting this team.
Sounds similar to last season.

Raptors need to improve home performance to contend in the East

COMMENT
The Toronto Raptors made their long-awaited return to Scotiabank Arena after an entire season spent in Tampa. Unfortunately, not only did the Raptors lose their home opener, but they’ve struggled to recapture the same home magic that they had during their dominant postseason runs.

It’s now been 14 games into the season and the Raptors have had eight home dates. They have won only two of those eight games, yet have gone 5-1 away from Toronto. The trend of poor performances at home continued Saturday night against the Detroit Pistons in a 127-121 loss.

Scotiabank Arena has become a difficult place for the Raptors to perform. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raptors had built a fortress at home for years. They lost their first three at home this season, snapping that stretch with a 118-100 victory over Indiana on October 27.

Overall the start to the season has been decent by the Raptors. In head coach Nick Nurse’s eyes:

“It’s effort…They play really hard, man. It takes a lot of effort to get on the glass and then if you’re getting on the glass to still get back,” Nurse said. “Some of the stats are showing you the effort: the turnovers, the offensive rebounding, the defensive transition, they’re showing a lot of effort and that’s as simple as that.”


Why are the Toronto Raptors struggling at home?
The effort hasn’t translated to wins during home dates. Toronto had previously been an impregnable wall between 2013 and 2020. Not including last season, the Raptors had won 58 home games combined over the 2019 and 2020 seasons. Last year, they lost more games in Tampa than they did in the prior 2 years in Toronto.

In their first seven home contests, the Raptors had averaged 102.5 points per game while their season average was 104.2 per game. The Raptors did score 121 points on Saturday, well above their average, but it still was not enough to win.

In their first seven home dates, their opponents amassed a scoring average of 105.6 points per game. In contrast, the Raptors are allowing opponents 99 points per game in their first six road contests. It is a dramatic difference being that much better defensively on the road than at home.

Pascal Siakam, who played his third game Saturday night contributed a double-double effort after returning from shoulder surgery. His return may help elevate the offense’s production once he’s up to speed. However, it may not be enough o completely reverse their fortunes at home.

The defense has been stingy overall. However, they need to duplicate their road successes at home and become more consistent no matter where they play. Saturday night they failed in this effort allowing the Pistons a season-high points allowed of 127.


What will turn the Toronto Raptors around?
Only OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and Chris Boucher remain from that pre-pandemic roster. With all the turmoil over the last two seasons and plenty of new team members in an unfamiliar place, time and patience might be all that’s needed.

The plethora of youth on the roster needs time to gel, build chemistry and find its identity as a team. The younger stars may be playing with nervous energy to endear themselves to the home crowd while trying to figure out the pace and tempo of the NBA game.

As a team, they are moving in the right direction overall. They have already earned a five-game winning streak and are dominating teams on the offensive glass.

It’s early in the season with 68 games still to come. These stats may be temporary blips that will be forgotten or corrected. They also pose the potential of being the initial formation of trends otherwise known as bad habits if not broken soon.

Hovering around .500 is probably better than some expected of the Raptors to this point of the season. Whether it’s better defensive rebounding, more shot attempts, and more consistent scoring at home, this team could find itself as a playoff contender rather than barely fighting to secure a play-in playoff spot in April.

Saturday night’s effort is hopefully just a temporary setback.

COMMENT
The Toronto Raptors have been buoyed by the emergence of rookie stud Scottie Barnes this season, as his rise from raw Florida State defensive specialist to a legitimate offensive weapon has been genuinely inspiring to watch. Barnes went from a Rookie of the Year afterthought to a legit contender for the award and media darling.

Barnes is averaging 16.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game this season. Not only has Nick Nurse given him a ton of responsibility on the defensive end, but he’s given him a green light to shoot from mid-range whenever he pleases. He’s not prime Dirk Nowitzki yet, but he’s certainly further along in that area than most expected.

Barnes’ hot start is not just a phenomenon that has been limited to Toronto, as his penchant for highlight-reel plays has helped him command the spotlight from the larger basketball media landscape. The always loquacious Charles Barkley is a big fan of Barnes and his potential to take home some silverware this year.

On a recent podcast appearance, Barkley seemed to be all-in on Barnes’ Rookie of the Year potential, as he emphatically decreed that Barnes will be able to beat out some of the players drafted above him and give the Raptors their third ROY winner.


Will Toronto Raptors star Scottie Barnes win Rookie of the Year in 2021-22?
The biggest competitor Barnes has for this award at the moment seems to be Cavaliers big man Evan Mobley. While Barnes has the slight edge in the eyes of many at this point, it looks like these two will be locked in a very tough battle for this coveted prize.

The top two selections in Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green will likely give Barnes a challenge for this award, but they will need to overcome some historic production from No. 4 to do so.

Barnes recorded 170 points and 85 rebounds while making over half of his shots in his first 10 games. The only other player since 1985 to do that? Some dude named Shaquille O’Neal. When his offensive start is taken in tandem with his defense it becomes clear that he is a truly elite young prospect still scratching the surface of how good he can be.

Damian Lillard Reveals Injury He’s Had For 4 Seasons

Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard revealed on Tuesday he’s been dealing with the same injury for almost four years.

Portland ruled Lillard out of Sunday’s Trail Blazers-Nuggets game due to an abdomen injury. Without him, Portland fell 118-113.

The good news is Lillard returned to action on Monday night against the Toronto Raptors. He poured in 24 points to go along with eight assists and four rebounds in a 118-113 win.

The bad news is Lillard’s abdomen injury is something he’s been dealing with for almost four years. It’s simply an injury he will have to play through.


Here’s all Damian Lillard had to say about the injury:

“It’s tight, irritated,” Lillard said, via Clutch Points. “It’s frustrating, but I’ve been playing with it for the last three-and-a-half, four seasons. It’s just frustrating. I’m ready to be playing in the prime of my career at 100 percent, and it’s frustrating to not be able to do that over the last three, four years.”

It’s pretty remarkable Damian Lillard has been playing through an abdomen injury for so long. Imagine what he’d be capable of at 100 percent and not dealing with any injuries.

Earlier this year, Lillard conveyed he spent most of the summer resting and rehabbing.

“At this point it’s just gonna be managing it,” Lillard said of his injury. “This summer I rested a lot, took a lot of time. Did a lot of the training and the rehab stuff, foundation stuff. I’d been feeling really good, but obviously once you start playing so many games and the wear and tear of the season, you never know how that’s gonna go. That’s the frustrating part. It’s just gonna be day-to-day managing it and finding a way to stay on the floor.”

Lillard and the Trail Blazers will get back to work this Wednesday against the Chicago Bulls.

Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr. (born July 15, 1990[1]) is an American professional basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Weber State Wildcats and earned third-team All-American honors in 2012. After being selected by Portland with the sixth overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft, Lillard was unanimously voted the NBA Rookie of the Year. Nicknamed "Dame Time" for his history of making big shots in the clutch, he has received six NBA All-Star selections and is one of two players in Trail Blazers franchise history, along with Clyde Drexler, to become a six-time All-Star.

High school career
Lillard began his high school career at Arroyo High School in San Lorenzo, California,[2] and joined the varsity starting lineup as a 5 ft 5 in (1.65 m) freshman.[3] He sought to transfer when his coach did not return to the team.[3] For his sophomore year, Lillard transferred to St. Joseph Notre Dame High School in Alameda, California, the same private school that had produced former NBA point guard Jason Kidd; but by year's end, a lack of playing time prompted Lillard to transfer schools yet again. He went on to play for coach Orlando Watkins at Oakland High School, where he was First Team All-League his junior and senior years. Over his junior campaign, Lillard averaged 19.4 points a night.[4] As a senior, he averaged 22.4 points and 5.2 assists per game while leading the Oakland Wildcats to a 23–9 record.[4]

Regarded only as a two-star prospect by Rivals.com,[5] Lillard was not heavily recruited out of high school, but he accepted a scholarship offer to play for Weber State, a Big Sky Conference program in Ogden, Utah.[6]

College career
As a freshman at Weber State, Lillard averaged 11.5 points per game and was named the Big Sky Conference Freshman of the Year and first-team All-Big Sky. In his sophomore year, he raised his scoring average to 19.9 points per game and led the Wildcats to the conference championship. At the end of the season, Lillard was named Big Sky Player of the Year as well as honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press.[7]

In 2010–11, Lillard led the Big Sky in scoring with 19.7 points per contest before suffering a foot injury ten games into the season that forced him to take a medical redshirt and sidelined him for the rest of the year.[8]

As a redshirt junior, Lillard averaged 24.5 points and led the nation in scoring throughout most of the year but ended up finishing second to Oakland University's Reggie Hamilton. On December 3, 2011, against San Jose State, Lillard scored a college career-high 41 points, including a game-clinching three-point play to give Weber State a 91–89 double-overtime win.[9] At the end of the year, he was named to his third first-team all-conference selection and won his second Big Sky Player of the Year award. Lillard was also a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award.[10]

Widely regarded as the top point guard prospect in the country, Lillard decided to skip his senior season to enter the 2012 NBA draft.[11] He finished his college career as the No. 2 scorer in Weber State history (1,934 points) and the No. 5 scorer in Big Sky history.

Professional career
Portland Trail Blazers (2012–present)
2012–13 season: Rookie of the Year

Lillard was selected with the sixth overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers. In the season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 31, Lillard recorded 23 points and 11 assists to join Oscar Robertson and Allen Iverson as the only players in NBA history with at least 20 points and 10 assists in their NBA debut. In addition, his 11 assists were the most by an NBA rookie in his first game since Jason Kidd (11) in 1994, and the most ever by a Trail Blazer in his NBA debut. Lillard made a career-high 15 field goals and a Trail Blazer rookie-record seven 3-pointers on January 11 against the Golden State Warriors, where he finished with 37 points, six rebounds, and four assists. He became the first Trail Blazer to win an event at the NBA All-Star Weekend, winning the Skills Challenge. He also participated in the Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend and finished with 18 points, three rebounds and five assists in a game-high 28 minutes. Lillard became the first NBA rookie to record 35 points, nine assists and zero turnovers in a game since turnovers became a stat in 1978–79 against the San Antonio Spurs on March 8. On April 10 against the Lakers, Lillard scored a season-high 38 points.[12] He earned Western Conference Rookie of the Month honors for every month, becoming one of just eight players to sweep NBA Rookie of the Month honors since the inaugural award in 1981–82. He finished fifth in the NBA in 3-pointers made, 12th in points per game, tied for 16th in assists per game and tied for 23rd in free throw percentage. He was one of 10 NBA players to score 1,500 points, and he led all rookies in scoring (19.0 ppg), assists (6.5 apg), field goals (553) and free throws (271).[13]

With averages of 19.0 points, 3.1 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 0.90 steals, and 38.6 minutes in 82 games (all starting), Lillard not only claimed the NBA Rookie of the Year Award but joined Blake Griffin (2011), David Robinson (1990), and Ralph Sampson (1984) as the only unanimous winners.[14] He also joined Oscar Robertson and Allen Iverson as the only rookies in NBA history to tally in excess of 1,500 points and 500 assists for a season. Lillard became the fourth Trail Blazer in franchise history to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors and one of two to ever finish a season with at least 1,500 points and 500 assists (the other being Clyde Drexler in 1986–87 and 1991–92). Among other distinctions, he broke the all-time NBA rookie record for 3-pointers in a season (185), surpassing Stephen Curry's 166 three-pointers in 2009–10; became the Portland franchise leader for most 3-point field goals in a season, breaking Damon Stoudamire's record of 181 in 2004–05; and became the first rookie to lead the NBA in total minutes played (3,167) since Elvin Hayes in 1968–69.[13]

2013–14 season: First All-Star selection
In the season opener on October 30, Lillard scored 32 points against the Phoenix Suns. He had a second 32-point effort on December 7 against the Dallas Mavericks. On December 17, he had 36 points, 10 assists, and eight rebounds against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The following day, he had a second straight 36-point effort against the Minnesota Timberwolves. On January 7, in a 123–119 loss to the Sacramento Kings, Lillard scored a career-high 41 points, including 26 in the fourth quarter to break Portland's franchise record for most points in any quarter.[15] On February 7, he had a 38-point effort against the Indiana Pacers.[16] During All-Star weekend, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to take part in five events during the All-Star festivities: the Rising Stars Challenge, Skills Challenge, Three-Point Contest, Slam Dunk Contest, and the All-Star Game.[17]

Lillard started all 82 games for the second straight year and averaged 20.7 points, 5.6 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game. Portland finished fifth in the Western Conference with a 54–28 record and faced the Houston Rockets in the first round of the 2014 NBA playoffs. In Game 1 of the series, Lillard recorded 31 points and nine rebounds in his first playoff appearance to help propel Portland to a 122–120 overtime win over Houston.[18] In Game 6 of the series, Lillard became the first player to make a buzzer-beating shot to win a playoff series since Utah's John Stockton against Houston in 1997. Lillard's 3-pointer as time expired gave Portland a 99–98 victory over Houston, as he finished with 25 points to lift the Trail Blazers to their first playoff series win since 2000.[19] The Trail Blazers went on to lose in five games to the San Antonio Spurs in the second round. Lillard had a series-best game in Game 4 with a 25-point effort, helping the Trail Blazers win their sole game of the series.[16] At the season's end, Lillard was named to the All-NBA Third Team.[20]

2014–15 season
For the third straight season, Lillard started all 82 games for the Trail Blazers. He averaged career highs in points, rebounds, steals, and field goal percentage, but averaged a career-low 34 percent from three-point range. He shot well during the first two months of the season, before struggling with his shot from January onwards. Despite this, he set the record for most three-pointers in a player's first three seasons, led the team in Win Shares, and finished second in PER.[21] On December 19, 2014, he scored a career-high 43 points in a 129–119 triple-overtime win over the San Antonio Spurs.[22] Four days later, he had a 40-point effort against the Oklahoma City Thunder. On January 5, 2015, he had a 39-point effort against the Los Angeles Lakers.[23] On February 8, 2015, Lillard was selected as a replacement for the injured Blake Griffin in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game.[24] On March 4, 2015, Lillard recorded a career-high 18 rebounds in a 98-93 win over the Los Angeles Clippers.[25] The Trail Blazers finished the regular season as the fourth seed in the Western Conference with a 51–31 record. They faced the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the playoffs, where they lost in five games. Lillard shot 16 percent from three-point range during the series, hitting just 5-of-31 including going 0-of-6 in Game 1.[23]

2015–16 season: All-NBA 2nd Team Selection

On July 9, 2015, Lillard signed a five-year, $120 million contract extension with the Trail Blazers.[26] On October 28, 2015, Lillard recorded 21 points and 11 assists in a season-opening win over the New Orleans Pelicans. His one three-pointer made during the game was his 600th career three-point field goal, making him the fastest NBA player in history to reach the mark at 247 games. In addition, Lillard's 11 assists gave him 1,500 for his career, making him the fastest Trail Blazer to reach the milestone since Terry Porter (1987–88 season, 215 games).[27] In the following game on October 30 against the Phoenix Suns, Lillard became the fastest player to reach 5,000 points and 1,500 assists (248 games) since Derrick Rose (240 games).[28]

On December 12, in a loss to the New York Knicks, Lillard became the first Blazer since Clyde Drexler in 1991–92 to record 600 points and 150 assists during the team's first 25 games.[29] On December 21, Lillard missed the first game of his career with plantar fasciitis in his left foot, ending his streak of playing in 275 consecutive games. Backcourt partner C. J. McCollum also missed the game, leaving the Trail Blazers without their two leading scorers to face the Atlanta Hawks, subsequently losing the game 106–97.[30] He missed a further six games with the injury, returning to action on January 4 against the Memphis Grizzlies and recording 17 points and 7 assists in a 91–78 loss.[31] On January 8, he scored a then season-high 40 points in a loss to the Golden State Warriors.[32] On January 18, in a win over the Washington Wizards, he hit his 2,000th NBA field goal, one of only eight players to reach that mark since he entered the league in 2012–13.[33] On January 26, in a win over the Sacramento Kings, Lillard recorded 15 points and 13 assists for his 10th double-double of the season, a career high.[34] On February 19, he scored a career-high 51 points in a 137–105 win over the Golden State Warriors. He became the first player in NBA history to have at least 50 points, seven assists and six steals since the steal became an official statistic in 1973–74.[35] Two days later, he scored 30 points against the Utah Jazz, becoming the first Blazer to score at least 30 points in four consecutive games since Drexler accomplished the feat in 1991.[36] He extended that streak to five in the team's following game on February 23 against the Brooklyn Nets.[37] Over his first 300 games in the NBA, Lillard averaged 21.2 points and 6.2 assists per game. Only four other players in NBA history averaged 21 points and six assists over their first 300 games: Oscar Robertson (30.2 and 10.3), Nate Archibald (24.5 and 8.4), LeBron James (26.7 and 6.4) and Dwyane Wade (24.0 and 6.4).[38] On March 4, he had his second 50-point game of the season in a 117–115 loss to the Toronto Raptors.[39]

On March 8, Lillard had 41 points and 11 assists in a 116–109 overtime win over the Washington Wizards, recording his 15th straight game with 20-plus points. He also had his 400th assist of the season, making him the first Trail Blazer with 400-plus assists in each of his first four seasons.[40] In the Trail Blazers' season finale on April 13 against the Denver Nuggets, Lillard hit his 827th career three-pointer, besting Wesley Matthews' Portland franchise record of 826. Lillard finished the regular season with an average of 25.1 points per game, while C. J. McCollum averaged 20.8 – making them the first backcourt in Blazers' history to average 20 or more points apiece. Lillard also became the third Blazer to average 25-plus points, joining Drexler and Kiki Vandeweghe.[41] In the 2016 MVP Race, he finished 8th in total points received, scoring 26 points out of a possible 1310 points.[42]

After defeating the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs, the Trail Blazers moved on to face the Golden State Warriors in the second round. In Game 3 of the series, Lillard recorded 40 points and 10 assists to help the Trail Blazers win 120–108, cutting the Warriors' advantage in the series to 2–1.[43] The Trail Blazers went on to lose the series in five games.

2016–17 season
In the Trail Blazers' season opener on October 25, 2016, Lillard recorded 39 points on 13-of-20 shooting, as well as 9 rebounds and 6 assists in a 113–104 win over the Utah Jazz. With his first assist of the night, Lillard passed Jim Paxson for sixth on the franchise career list (2,008).[44] Four days later, he scored 37 points, including the go-ahead floater with less than a second remaining in overtime, to lead the Trail Blazers to a 115–113 win over the Denver Nuggets.[45] With 27 points against the Phoenix Suns on November 2, Lillard became the first NBA player to score 27 or more points in each of his team's first five games since Kobe Bryant in 2005–06. Lillard's 163 points in the season's first five games are the most ever by a Blazer to start a season.[46] Two days later, Lillard scored 27 of his season-high 42 points in the second half of the Trail Blazers' 105–95 win over the Dallas Mavericks.[47] With 38 points on November 8 against Phoenix, Lillard had 262 points over the first eight games of the season, the most through the first eight games of a season in franchise history. It was also the most by an NBA player since Bryant had 264 through the first eight in 2009–10.[48]

Lillard amassed a team-record 695 points in the Blazers' first 25 games of the season, eclipsing Clyde Drexler's previous mark of 681 in 1988.[49] He went on to miss five games between December 26 and January 4 after spraining his left ankle against San Antonio on December 23.[50] On January 28 against Golden State, Lillard reached 8,000 career points, becoming the 11th Blazer to hit the mark and joined Michael Jordan and LeBron James as the only three players to reach 8,000 points and 2,000 assists in their first five seasons.[51] On March 19, Lillard scored a season-high 49 points, tied a career high with nine three-pointers, and carried the Trail Blazers past the Miami Heat, 115–104.[52] On April 3, 2017, he was named Western Conference Player of the Month for games played in March. Behind Lillard, the Trail Blazers went an NBA-best 13–3 in March to surge into eighth place in the Western Conference. Lillard ranked third in the NBA in scoring (29.1 ppg) and tied for fourth in three-pointers made (55) to go with 6.0 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 1.44 steals in 16 games.[53] Five days later, Lillard scored a franchise-record 59 points and matched his career high with nine three-pointers to lead the Trail Blazers to a 101–86 win over the Jazz. It was Lillard's 27th game of the season with 30 or more points, a franchise high. He also became the fifth Blazer to score 2,000-plus points in a season.[54] After being 10 games under .500 at the All-Star break, Lillard helped the Trail Blazers to an 18–8 late-season surge to earned them the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference with a 41–41 record.[55] They faced the Golden State Warriors for the second straight year in the playoffs, this time in the first round. Portland went on to lose the series in a clean sweep despite Lillard's 34-point effort in Game 4. For the series, Lillard averaged 27.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 43% from the field, 28% from behind the arc, and 96% from the free throw line.[56] On May 2, 2017, he was named the recipient of the Magic Johnson Award for the 2016–17 season, which honors the player who best combines excellence on the basketball court with cooperation and dignity in dealing with the media and the public.[57]

2017–18 season: All-NBA First Team selection

Lillard in 2018
On October 28, 2017, in a 114–107 win over the Phoenix Suns, Lillard reached the 9,000-point milestone during the third quarter. With 402 career games, Lillard became the fastest Blazer to score 9,000 points.[58] On November 15, he had 26 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in a 99–94 win over the Orlando Magic. During the game, he surpassed Mychal Thompson (9,215 points) for eighth on the franchise's all-time scoring leaders list.[59] On November 27, he scored 32 points in a 103–91 win over the New York Knicks.

He moved into seventh in franchise history in scoring with 9,753 points, passing Geoff Petrie (9,732).[64] On January 22, Lillard was named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played January 15–21. It was his fourth career Player of the Week nod.[65] A day later, he was named a Western Conference All-Star reserve.[66] On February 2, he scored 32 points in a 130–105 loss to the Toronto Raptors, becoming the fastest player in franchise history to reach 10,000 points for his career.[67] He became the eighth player to get 10,000 points and 2,500 assists in his first six seasons, joining Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Larry Bird, Nate Archibald, Pete Maravich, Dave Bing and Oscar Robertson.[67] On February 9, in a 118–100 win over the Sacramento Kings, Lillard scored a season-high 50 points in 29 minutes—the fourth 50-point game of his career.

The win earned the Trail Blazers the third seed in the playoffs with a 49–33 record.

Lillard returned to play in the last four Blazers' games before the NBA hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic; during this span, he averaged 20.8 points, 3.8 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per contest while shooting 40 percent from the field, 41.2 percent on 3-pointers, and 87.5 percent at the free-throw line.[112] On June 30, 2020, Lillard was selected to be the cover athlete for NBA 2K21.

This was his third 60-point outing of the season, joining Wilt Chamberlain as the only two players in league history to have such games three times in a single season.[115]
